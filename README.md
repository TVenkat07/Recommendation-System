# 📌 Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project builds a **Recommendation System** using **Collaborative Filtering** and **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**. The system suggests items to users based on past interactions and similarities between users or items.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Contains:** User-item interactions (ratings, purchases, or preferences).  
- **Structure:**  
  - `UserID`: Unique identifier for users.  
  - `ItemID`: Unique identifier for items.  
  - `Rating`: User's rating for a given item (if available).  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for implementation  

## 📊 Methods Implemented  
### 1️⃣ **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**  
- Measures similarity between users using **Cosine Similarity**.  
- Recommends items liked by similar users.  

### 2️⃣ **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**  
- Computes similarity between items based on user interactions.  
- Recommends items similar to those previously interacted with.  

### 3️⃣ **Matrix Factorization using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**  
- Decomposes the user-item matrix into latent factors.  
- Predicts missing ratings to recommend items.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Recommendation-System.git
   cd Recommendation-System
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and execute `Recommendation_System.ipynb`  

## 🔥 Results  
- Provides personalized recommendations for users based on past interactions.  
- Generates a ranked list of recommended items.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Implement deep learning-based recommendation models.  
- Deploy the system as a web application.
